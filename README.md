# Age_and_Gender_Prediction_using_ResNet50
 This project demonstrates a multi-output deep learning model for predicting age and gender using the UTKFace dataset. The model leverages a pre-trained ResNet50 backbone for feature extraction, followed by custom layers for age regression and gender classification. The data is augmented, and predictions are evaluated against true labels.
